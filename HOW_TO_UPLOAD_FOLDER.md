# How to Upload Your Starter Folder

## Method 1: Drag and Drop (Easiest)

1. **Open Finder** (file manager on Mac)
2. **Navigate to your folder** (the starter code folder)
3. **Drag the folder** into Cursor's file explorer
4. The folder will be copied to your project

## Method 2: Copy via Terminal

If you have the folder somewhere else on your computer:

```bash
# Copy the folder to your project
cp -r /path/to/your/starter/folder /Users/faialradhi/Shaykha-project4/starter

# Or if you want to replace the existing starter folder:
rm -rf /Users/faialradhi/Shaykha-project4/starter
cp -r /path/to/your/starter/folder /Users/faialradhi/Shaykha-project4/
```

## Method 3: Tell Me the Path

Just tell me:
- Where is your starter folder located?
- What's the full path?

Then I can help you copy it!

## Current Structure

Your project currently has:
```
starter/
├── frontend/
└── backend/
```

## What Should Be in Starter Folder

Based on the reference project, `starter/` should contain:
- `frontend/` - React TypeScript application
- `backend/` - Python Flask application

## After Uploading

Once you upload your folder:
1. I'll verify the structure matches
2. Update workflows if needed
3. Test that everything works
4. Commit and push to GitHub

**Just drag your folder into Cursor, or tell me where it is!**
